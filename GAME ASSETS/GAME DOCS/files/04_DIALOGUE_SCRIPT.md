**UI Prompt:**

**When hovering over SOLDIER:**
> "Or Soldier—orc bastard, loved a good scrap. Bit TOO enthusiastic sometimes."

**After selecting CHEF:**
> "So I brought Chef along. Figure'd I'd need someone to tank the hits while I did the... collectin'."
> 
> "And Soldier? Well, he gave me his axe. Said [gruff impression] 'If yer gonna fight like a fairy, at least swing somethin' HEAVY.'"

**After selecting SOLDIER:**
> "Brought Soldier with me. Figure'd brute force was the way to go."

**First Goblin Kill:**
> "Aye, that's how ye do it! Quick slash, down they go!"

> 
> [dramatic pause, leans forward]

**MC:**
> "He looked at me with those beady red eyes... and I SWEAR he KNEW why I was there."

**BILL (boss roar - just aggressive chicken sounds):**
> "BAWK-BAWK-BAKAAAAAAW!"

**MC:**
> "Aye, that's rooster for 'I'M GONNA KILL YE.'"

> 
> "I stepped aside, swung me [weapon]—"

---

### **Bill Defeat:**

**Slow-motion fall:**

**MC:**
> "And DOWN he went. Slow motion, like in one of those fancy plays. Hit the ground with a THUD that shook the whole farm."

**Bill hits ground, loot explosion:**

**MC:**

> 
> [points]
> 
> "—his MAGNIFICENT black plume. The finest feather I'd ever seen."
